## 🤖 AI-Ready Work (8 ready, 18 labeled)

### Ready to Work Now (unblocked)

**Crew Maintenance:**
- **gm-prr** [task] P3 - Add .runtime/ to crew gitignore files
- **gm-yds** [task] P3 - Check if gt hook/sling workarounds still needed after gt upgrade

**Verification Tasks (Priority):**
- **gm-et9** [task] P2 - [VERIFY] Deacon propagates 'Do Your Job' signal to workers
- **gm-ldg** [task] P2 - [VERIFY] Patrol agents use exponential backoff when idle
- **gm-9g1** [task] P3 - [VERIFY] gt handoff gracefully restarts worker
- **gm-b1g** [task] P3 - [VERIFY] Rig workers can work cross-rig with gt worktree

**Convoy Work:**

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Today)

1. **P0: Tailscale key expiry** (gm-91g)
   - Send urgent notification to overseer
   - Key expires today - needs immediate renewal

2. **Clean up orphaned in_progress tasks**
   - Reset gm-5v5, gm-9to, gm-rpc, gm-uxw to open status
   - Or reassign to active workers

3. **Prioritize verification convoy unblocking**
   - Work on gm-et9 (P2 - Deacon propagates DYFJ)
   - Work on gm-ldg (P2 - Exponential backoff)
   - These unblock convoy gm-bgh

### This Week

4. **Crew maintenance tasks**
   - gm-prr: Add .runtime/ to gitignore
   - gm-yds: Check if workarounds still needed

5. **Follow up on human-blocked infrastructure**
   - Check status of LumiCello PostgreSQL credentials
   - Check status of tanwa.info deployment

### Strategic

6. **Review convoy work**
   - gm-cv-re4ju: tanwa.info Content Sections
   - gm-cv-rgqcu: Infrastructure Audit
   - Consider breaking down or delegating

---

## 📈 Health Metrics

**Positive indicators:**
- ✅ No overdue issues
- ✅ All issues properly triaged
- ✅ Clear ownership labels
- ✅ Active verification work in progress

**Areas for improvement:**
- ⚠️ 4 orphaned in_progress tasks (24% of in-progress work)
- ⚠️ 45% of open work is human-blocked (bottleneck)
- ⚠️ Large verification convoy blocked by multiple dependencies

**Velocity:**
- 8 ready tasks available for immediate work
- 2 high-priority (P2) verification tasks unblocked
- Convoy progress gated by dependency completion

---

## Next Steps

1. Execute immediate action: Send urgent notification for gm-91g (Tailscale expiry)
2. Clean up orphaned tasks (reset or reassign)
3. Work verification tasks to unblock convoy
4. Monitor human-blocked issues for unblocking opportunities
