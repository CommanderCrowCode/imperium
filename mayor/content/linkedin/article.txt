Delegation fails instantly
without context.

AI isn't dumb—
but it doesn't know you
if you've never told it who you are.

Without context,
AI responds to you like it responds to everyone else.

That's why I obsessively focus on one thing:

Capture context DURING work, not after it's done.

What I capture:
    •    Requirements & constraints
    •    Decisions + reasoning
    •    Work roadmaps
    •    Family logistics
    •    Tech stack / infrastructure choices

Everything must be in a format
AI can consume immediately.

Version control matters—not just for code.
Because AI doesn't just read "current state."
It reads the evolution of your decisions.

Git works for code.
But the same principle applies to:
    •    Meeting notes
    •    Design docs
    •    Decision logs

Direct questions for you:

Where is your context right now?
How well does AI actually know you?
