## ✅ Ready Work (9 issues)

Issues available for autonomous execution:

1. **gm-prr** [P3] - Add .runtime/ to crew gitignore files
2. **gm-yds** [P3] - Check if gt hook/sling workarounds still needed after gt upgrade
3. **gm-et9** [P2] [VERIFY] - Deacon propagates 'Do Your Job' signal to workers
4. **gm-ldg** [P2] [VERIFY] - Patrol agents use exponential backoff when idle
5. **gm-9g1** [P3] [VERIFY] - gt handoff gracefully restarts worker
6. **gm-b1g** [P3] [VERIFY] - Rig workers can work cross-rig with gt worktree
7. **gm-cv-re4ju** [P2] - tanwa.info Content Sections
8. **gm-cv-rgqcu** [P2] - Infrastructure Audit
9. **gm-9ke** [P4] - Test task for crash survival verification

**Recommendation:** These are primarily verification tests (Gas Town behavior suite) and maintenance tasks. Can be slung to polecats for autonomous execution.

## 📈 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **CRITICAL:** Escalate fd-2rs to overseer for Tailscale key renewal
2. **Dispatch Ready Work:** Sling 2-3 verification tests to polecats for autonomous execution
3. **Review Human Queue:** 17 human-required issues - prioritize P0-P1

### Strategic Focus
- **Verification Suite (gm-bgh):** 9 ready subtasks available. Can be executed in parallel to unblock the epic.
- **Maintenance:** gitignore cleanup (gm-prr) and workaround audit (gm-yds) are low-priority housekeeping
- **Infrastructure:** Town is healthy with 32 active sessions and all witnesses running

## 🎯 Suggested Next Actions

**For Mayor:**
1. Send mail to overseer about fd-2rs P0 overdue issue
2. Create convoy for verification tests (gm-et9, gm-ldg, gm-9g1, gm-b1g)
3. Review human-required queue for items that can be unblocked

**For Overseer (Human):**
1. **URGENT:** Renew Tailscale key on darling-nikki server (fd-2rs)
2. Review 16 other human-required issues for decisions/approvals
3. Consider infrastructure budget decisions for lumicello projects
