# Boot Triage Report: 2026-01-08 03:19

## 🚨 Critical Alerts

### Tailscale Key Expiry (3 days overdue)
- **Issue**: gm-91g - Tailscale key expired 2026-01-05
- **Age**: Created Jan 5 20:55, now Jan 8 03:19 (3 days old)
- **Status**: Continuous git activity through Jan 6-8 suggests connectivity working
- **Action**: Human verification needed
  - Was key renewed?
  - Is Tailscale functioning? (`tailscale status`)
  - Can we close gm-91g?
- **Note**: If key wasn't renewed and Tailscale is down, requires immediate human action: `tailscale up --reset`

## 📊 Work Status

### Ready Work: 10 issues (0 overdue)
All ready work is verification tasks for Gas Town behaviors:

**P2 Verification Tasks (5)**:
- gm-uxw: Witness detects stuck polecats (5+ min inactive)
- gm-rpc: Refinery merges one-at-a-time to main
- gm-et9: Deacon propagates 'Do Your Job' signal to workers
- gm-9to: Refinery escalates unresolvable conflicts
- gm-ldg: Patrol agents use exponential backoff when idle
- gm-5v5: Polecats fully decommissioned after merge

**P3 Tasks (4)**:
- gm-prr: Add .runtime/ to crew gitignore files
- gm-yds: Check if gt hook/sling workarounds still needed
- gm-9g1: Verify gt handoff gracefully restarts worker
- gm-b1g: Verify rig workers can work cross-rig with gt worktree

### Main Convoy: Gas Town Verification Suite (gm-bgh)
- **Progress**: 1/8 completed (12.5%)
- **Status**: Hooked to boot (in_progress), blocked by 6 dependencies
- **Completed**: ✓ gm-7ln (Dogs handle Deacon's complex work)
- **Pending Boot**: gm-5tc, gm-vhd (2 boot-assigned tests)
- **Ready to Sling**: gm-5v5, gm-9to, gm-et9, gm-ldg, gm-rpc (5 tasks, P2)

### Active Convoys
1. **gm-bgh**: Gas Town Behavior Verification Suite (1/8 complete, blocked)
2. **gm-cv-rgqcu**: Infrastructure Audit (in progress)
3. **gm-cv-re4ju**: tanwa.info Content Sections (in progress)

## 📬 Mail Queue: 16 unread messages

**Urgent items**:
1. gm-wj1b: Tailscale status check (from mayor, 3 days old)
2. gm-rfh4: Status check: Tailscale key renewal (gm-91g, fd-2rs)

**Human inputs needed**:
- ti-5n2: tanwa_info human input (gm-ppg)
- ds-aoi: 10x_screening P1 issue (gm-xo4)
- inventory_management-vdk: P1 issue (gm-96b)
- inventory_management-amj: P0 issue (gm-86b)

**Infrastructure gaps**:
- mol-deacon-patrol not defined (gm-0m1)
- GitHub secrets & Infisical for lumicello (gm-4ui)
- PostgreSQL credentials for LumiCello (gm-t8b)

**Cannot reproduce**:
- ds-2p3: Bug needs clarification from 10x_screening/bugfix (gm-aw1)

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Human)
1. **Verify Tailscale status**: Run `tailscale status` to confirm connectivity
2. **Close gm-91g**: If key renewed and Tailscale up, close the 3-day-old alert
3. **Renew if needed**: If Tailscale down, run `tailscale up --reset`

### Next Session (Mayor/Boot)
1. **Unblock main convoy**: Sling 5× ready P2 verification tasks to polecats:
   - gm-5v5, gm-9to, gm-et9, gm-ldg, gm-rpc
2. **Boot assignments**: Execute gm-5tc and gm-vhd (boot-assigned tests)
3. **Follow up on mail**: Check status of human-input-needed items

### Infrastructure
1. Address Infisical setup for lumicello (gm-4ui)
2. Obtain PostgreSQL credentials for LumiCello (gm-t8b)
3. Define mol-deacon-patrol molecule (gm-0m1)

## 📈 Trend Analysis

**Positive**:
- Continuous git activity (no connectivity disruption detected)
- Main convoy progressing (1/8 complete)
- 10 ready tasks available for dispatch
- No new P0/P1 alerts

**Concerns**:
- **3-day-old Tailscale alert unresolved** (communication gap?)
- Main convoy blocked by 6 verification tasks
- 4 human-input items in queue (1× P0, 2× P1)
- Infrastructure setup gaps blocking rig work

**Recommendation**:
1. **Human**: Resolve Tailscale alert immediately (verify or close)
2. **Mayor**: Batch-spawn 5 polecats for P2 verification tasks to accelerate main convoy
3. **Boot**: Execute assigned verification tests (gm-5tc, gm-vhd)

## 🏗️ Next Steps for Boot

Since gm-bgh is hooked to boot and contains boot-assigned tests:
1. Execute gm-5tc: Polecat crash survival test
2. Execute gm-vhd: Graceful degradation test
3. Report results to convoy

Boot should prioritize these to unblock convoy progress alongside polecat dispatch.
