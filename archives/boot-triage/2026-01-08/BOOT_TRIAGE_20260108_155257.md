## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### For Mayor (Immediate)
1. **Execute verification convoy** - 6× P2 verification tasks ready
   - Consider creating convoy for batch execution
   - These unblock gm-bgh when complete
   
2. **Review P0 human-blocked** - gm-86b needs attention
   - inventory_management-amj marked P0
   - May need overseer escalation

### For Overseer (When Available)
1. **Infrastructure blockers** - 4 issues need credentials/deployment
2. **Clarification requests** - 4 issues waiting on human input

## 🔍 System Health Indicators

**Positive:**
- No overdue work (good deadline tracking)
- No urgent alerts (stable operations)
- 9 ready issues (healthy backlog)
- All P2 verification work (quality focus)

**Watch:**
- 8 human-blocked issues (potential bottleneck)
- 1 convoy blocked by verification tasks (cascading dependencies)

**Recommendation:** Focus on verification tasks to unblock convoy, then escalate human-blocked issues if they remain stalled.
