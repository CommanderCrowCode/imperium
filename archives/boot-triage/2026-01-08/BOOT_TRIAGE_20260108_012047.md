## Ready Work (10 Issues)

### Immediate Action

2. **gm-prr** [P3] - Add .runtime/ to crew gitignore files
3. **gm-yds** [P3] - Check if gt hook/sling workarounds still needed

### Verification Suite (Gas Town Tests)
4. **gm-et9** [P2] - [VERIFY] Deacon propagates DYFJ signal
5. **gm-ldg** [P2] - [VERIFY] Patrol exponential backoff
6. **gm-9g1** [P3] - [VERIFY] gt handoff graceful restart
7. **gm-b1g** [P3] - [VERIFY] Cross-rig work with gt worktree

### Strategic Work
8. **gm-cv-re4ju** [P2] - Convoy: tanwa.info Content Sections
9. **gm-cv-rgqcu** [P2] - Convoy: Infrastructure Audit
10. **gm-9ke** [P4] - Test task for crash survival verification

## Blocked Work (1 Issue)

**gm-bgh** [P2] - Gas Town Behavior Verification Suite
- Blocked by 7 verification tests (items 4-7 above + 3 others)
- Once tests complete, this convoy can land

## Human-Required Issues (1 Message)

**gm-a5f** - Boot Triage Complete: 7 human-required, 10 agent-ready
- Old triage message from 2026-01-06
- Likely resolved by now

## Active Polecats (16 Working)

### tanwa_info (3 working)
- furiosa, rictus, slit actively working on beads

### 10x_screening (6 working)
- batch, bugfix, cleaner, designer, furiosa, viz all active
- nux stopped

### tools_cc_monitor (1 working)
- nux working with 2 unread messages (MR branch not pushed)

### flamingo_dominion (2 working)
- furiosa, nux both working

### lumicello_website (0 working)
- furiosa, nux both stopped (but marked as working - stale state?)

## Action Items

### Immediate (Mayor Should Handle)
1. ⚠️ **Restart Deacon** - Session marked [dead]
2. 🔍 **Investigate lumicello_website polecats** - Stopped but status shows "working"
3. 📬 **Check unread mail** - 25 unread messages (some may contain work)

### Ready to Dispatch
- 10 ready issues available for slinging
- Focus on verification tests to unblock gm-bgh convoy

### Monitor
- 13 MRs in queue across 6 rigs (refineries should process these)
- tanwa_info has 7 pending MRs (highest queue)

## Trends
- **Last 24h**: 3 issues created, 0 closed, 14 updated
- **Avg Lead Time**: 3.4 hours (good velocity)
- **Active Work**: 7 in-progress + 16 polecats working = healthy activity level

## Recommended Actions

**Priority 1**: Restart Deacon
```bash
tmux kill-session -t gt-deacon
gt spawn deacon
```

**Priority 2**: Dispatch verification tests
- Sling gm-et9, gm-ldg, gm-9g1, gm-b1g to available polecats
- This unblocks the verification suite convoy

**Priority 3**: Process mail queue
- 25 unread messages may contain work assignments or escalations
- Review and respond to urgent items
