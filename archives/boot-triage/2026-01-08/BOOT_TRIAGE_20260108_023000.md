## ✅ READY WORK (9 Issues)

Agent-actionable work with no blockers:

### Verification Tests (P2-P3)
- **gm-et9** [P2] [VERIFY] Deacon propagates 'Do Your Job' signal to workers
- **gm-ldg** [P2] [VERIFY] Patrol agents use exponential backoff when idle
- **gm-9g1** [P3] [VERIFY] gt handoff gracefully restarts worker
- **gm-b1g** [P3] [VERIFY] Rig workers can work cross-rig with gt worktree

### Maintenance (P3-P4)
- **gm-prr** [P3] Add .runtime/ to crew gitignore files
- **gm-yds** [P3] Check if gt hook/sling workarounds still needed after gt upgrade
- **gm-9ke** [P4] Test task for crash survival verification

### Convoy Work (P2)
- **gm-cv-re4ju** [P2] tanwa.info Content Sections
- **gm-cv-rgqcu** [P2] Infrastructure Audit

---

## 🚧 BLOCKED WORK (1 Issue)

### Epic Blocked by Dependencies
- **gm-bgh** [P2] Gas Town Behavior Verification Suite
  - **Blocked by**: 7 verification tests (gm-5tc, gm-5v5, gm-9to, gm-et9, gm-ldg, gm-rpc, gm-vhd)
  - **Type**: Epic
  - **Impact**: Cannot complete until all subtests done
  - **Note**: 4 ready tests listed above; others may be complete or need triage

---

## 👤 HUMAN-REQUIRED WORK (17 Issues)

Issues requiring human input, decision, or approval:

### High Priority
- **gm-91g** [P0] 🚨 Tailscale key expires TODAY (fd-2rs) - `human:decision`
- **gm-ppg** [P2] 🚧 Human input needed: ti-5n2 - `human:decision`
- **gm-aw1** [P2] 🔍 ds-2p3: Cannot reproduce bug - `human:blocked`
- **gm-4ui** [P2] 🔧 GitHub secrets & Infisical for lumicello webapp - `human:blocked`

### Review/Coordination (P2)
- **gm-bek** [P2] 📊 Boot Triage: gm-bgh Convoy Status - `human:review`
- **gm-d6o** [P2] ✅ Verification approach: Delegate to Boot - `human:review`
- **gm-psu** [P2] Re: Verification tests - convoy approach - `human`
- **gm-axc** [P2] 🎯 Triage Review: P0 Action + 10 Tests Ready - `human`
- **gm-0m1** [P2] 🚧 Infrastructure gap: mol-deacon-patrol not defined - `human`
- **gm-a5f** [P2] 📋 Boot Triage Complete: 7 human-required, 10 agent-ready - `human`

### Other (7 more human-required issues not shown in top 10)

## 🏗️ INFRASTRUCTURE STATUS

### Active Sessions
- **32 tmux sessions** running (Gas Town components)
- Includes: Mayor, Witnesses, Refineries, Polecats, Deacon, Dogs

### Polecat Status
- All rig polecat directories exist but empty (no active polecats detected)
- This is expected if no work is currently slung to workers
- Workers spawn on-demand when work is assigned via `gt-sling-fix`

### Known Gaps (from CLAUDE.md)
- `gt sling` doesn't auto-spawn sessions → Use `~/gt/bin/gt-sling-fix`
- Witness stuck detection inaccurate → Uses bead status, not session activity
- Various other workarounds tracked in gm-* beads

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (Human)
1. **P0**: Resolve Tailscale expiry (fd-2rs) - run `tailscale up --reset`
2. **Review**: Check 17 human-required issues in mail for context
3. **Triage**: Previous triage reports in mail may need archiving

### Bot/Agent Work
1. **Verification Sprint**: 4 ready verification tests can be slung to polecats
   - Consider convoy: `gt convoy create "Verification Tests" gm-et9 gm-ldg gm-9g1 gm-b1g`
2. **Maintenance**: gm-prr (gitignore) and gm-yds (workaround check) are low-effort
3. **Epic Progress**: Check if gm-bgh blockers (7 tests) are actually complete

### Housekeeping
1. Archive old triage reports (32 mail messages in overseer inbox)
2. Review convoy gm-cv-* status (2 issues ready)
3. Check if human-blocked issues have been resolved

---

## 📈 TRENDS

### Since Last Triage (2026-01-08 02:05)
- No change in ready work (9 issues)
- No change in blocked work (1 issue)
- Human-required count stable (17 issues)
- P0 Tailscale still overdue (3 days)

### Positive
- No overdue issues (except Tailscale which is human-required)
- Infrastructure healthy (32 active sessions)
- Clear separation of human vs agent work

### Concerns
- P0 Tailscale expiry unresolved for 3 days
- No active polecats (no work being executed)
- Verification epic (gm-bgh) progress unclear
- Many triage reports accumulating in mail

## 📋 NEXT STEPS

**For Human (Overseer):**
1. Resolve fd-2rs Tailscale expiry
2. Review and archive old triage mails
3. Clarify blocked issues (ds-2p3, ti-5n2, etc.)

**For Mayor:**
1. Consider slinging verification tests to polecats
2. Check convoy status for gm-cv-* work
3. Audit epic gm-bgh progress

**For Boot:**
1. Continue 5-minute patrol cycle
2. Generate fresh triage on next wake
3. Escalate if P0 remains unresolved
