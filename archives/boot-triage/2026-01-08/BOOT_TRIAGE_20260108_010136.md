## 🔍 Observations

1. **Healthy baseline:** No critical (P0/P1) or overdue issues
2. **Ready work available:** 9 issues ready for assignment to polecats
3. **Human-required backlog:** 17 issues waiting on human input (many appear to be mail/triage beads)
4. **No active workers:** All polecats dormant - no active tmux sessions
5. **Convoy gm-bgh blocked:** Waiting on 7 verification tasks to complete
6. **Infrastructure healthy:** All 6 rigs have proper agent structure

---

## 💡 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Archive mail beads:** Many "human-required" issues are triage reports/notifications that can be closed
2. **Sling ready work:** 9 issues available - consider slinging verification tasks to polecats
3. **Review convoy gm-bgh:** Check if blocking tasks are truly needed or can be unblocked

### Strategic
1. **Cleanup triage mail:** Past triage reports (gm-bek, gm-a5f, gm-axc, etc.) should be archived
2. **Human decisions:** Several high-value issues waiting on human (infrastructure budget, credentials, deployments)
3. **Verification push:** Multiple [VERIFY] tasks ready - could be batched to a single polecat

---

## 📬 Mayor Inbox

22 unread messages in overseer inbox - mostly triage reports from previous boot runs.

**Suggested:** Archive historical triage reports to reduce noise.
