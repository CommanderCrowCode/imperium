# Boot Triage Report
**Date**: 2026-01-08 01:31
**Reporter**: mayor

## Executive Summary
- **9 Ready** issues (no blockers, agent-actionable)
- **1 Blocked** issue (gm-bgh verification suite - waiting on 7 dependencies)
- **0 Human-required** issues with explicit labels
- **P0 Tailscale issue** now 3 days overdue (fd-2rs, expired 2026-01-05)
- **Infrastructure**: Healthy - 32 Gas Town tmux sessions running

## Ready Work (9 issues)
All P2-P4, no P0/P1 in ready queue:

1. `gm-prr` [P3] Add .runtime/ to crew gitignore files
2. `gm-yds` [P3] Check if gt hook/sling workarounds still needed
3. `gm-et9` [P2] [VERIFY] Deacon signal propagation
4. `gm-ldg` [P2] [VERIFY] Patrol exponential backoff
5. `gm-9g1` [P3] [VERIFY] gt handoff graceful restart
6. `gm-b1g` [P3] [VERIFY] Cross-rig worktree workflow
7. `gm-cv-re4ju` [P2] tanwa.info Content Sections convoy
8. `gm-cv-rgqcu` [P2] Infrastructure Audit convoy
9. `gm-9ke` [P4] Test crash survival verification

## Blocked Work (1 issue)
- `gm-bgh` [P2] Gas Town Behavior Verification Suite
  - Blocked by 7 open verification tests
  - This is the parent epic tracking overall verification progress

## Critical Issues

### P0 OVERDUE: Tailscale Key Renewal (fd-2rs)
- **Status**: Open since 2026-01-05
- **Expired**: 3 days ago
- **Action**: Human must run `tailscale up --reset`
- **Impact**: Network access may be impaired

## Infrastructure Health
- **Gas Town sessions**: 32 active tmux sessions
- **Active polecats**: 0 currently working
- **Witnesses**: Running per-rig
- **Refineries**: Active
- **Deacon/Dogs**: Operational

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action (P0)
1. **Human**: Resolve fd-2rs Tailscale key renewal NOW

### Short-term (Today)
2. Sling verification tasks to polecats (gm-et9, gm-ldg ready to work)
3. Consider convoy approach for remaining verification tests

### Maintenance
4. Archive old boot triage mail (30+ messages in overseer inbox)

## Work Distribution Analysis
- No polecats currently active (all idle or decommissioned)
- Ready work exists but not yet assigned
- Verification tests can be parallelized

## Notes
- Human-blocked issues appear as mail beads (gm-86b, gm-96b, gm-xo4) but not in bd list --label
- No explicit `human-required` labels found in open issues
- Mail inbox has 30 unread messages (mostly previous triage reports)
