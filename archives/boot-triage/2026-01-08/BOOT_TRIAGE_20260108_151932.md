## 📬 Mayor Inbox
**Total:** 20 messages, all unread
**Recent themes:**
- Verification delegation status (gm-d1n7, gm-v7jq)
- Tailscale key renewal alerts (gm-91g, gm-rfh4, gm-wj1b)
- Human-required actions (infrastructure, credentials)
- Bug clarifications from polecats

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### Immediate (P2 Verification Tasks)
Since Boot is already working on 3 tasks, sling the remaining 6 P2 verification tasks:
1. gm-uxw (Witness stuck detection)
2. gm-rpc (Refinery sequential merge)
3. gm-et9 (Deacon DYFJ signal)
4. gm-9to (Refinery conflict escalation)
5. gm-ldg (Exponential backoff)
6. gm-5v5 (Polecat decommissioning)

**Strategy:** Delegate to Boot or spawn dedicated verification polecats.

### Pending Human Input
Multiple beads flagged for human action - mostly infrastructure/credentials:
- Tailscale key renewal (recurring alert)
- PostgreSQL credentials for LumiCello
- GitHub secrets & Infisical setup
- Deploy actions

### Content Convoy
gm-cv-re4ju (tanwa.info Content Sections) is ready but low priority vs verification suite.

## 🔍 Notes
- No overdue beads
- No emergency escalations
- Verification suite progressing as designed
- All polecats idle (work completed, awaiting new assignments)
- Deacon healthy and executing patrol

## Next Session Actions
1. Review Boot progress on current 3 verification tasks
2. Sling remaining 6 P2 verification tasks if Boot ready
3. Review mayor inbox for actionable items
4. Check if Tailscale key renewal needs escalation
