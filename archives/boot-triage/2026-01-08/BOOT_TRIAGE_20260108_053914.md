## 📊 Work Dashboard

### Blocked Work
```
gm-bgh: Gas Town Behavior Verification Suite
  Blocked by: gm-5tc, gm-5v5, gm-9to, gm-et9, gm-ldg, gm-rpc, gm-vhd
```

### Ready Work (9 issues)
**P2 Verification Tasks (6):**
- gm-uxw: Witness detects stuck polecats (5+ min inactive)
- gm-rpc: Refinery merges one-at-a-time to main
- gm-et9: Deacon propagates 'Do Your Job' signal to workers
- gm-9to: Refinery escalates unresolvable conflicts
- gm-ldg: Patrol agents use exponential backoff when idle
- gm-5v5: Polecats fully decommissioned after merge

**P3 Verification Tasks (2):**
- gm-9g1: gt handoff gracefully restarts worker
- gm-b1g: Rig workers can work cross-rig with gt worktree

**P2 Convoy (1):**
- gm-cv-re4ju: tanwa.info Content Sections

### In-Progress Work (3)
All assigned to `deacon/dogs/boot`:
- gm-bgh: Gas Town Behavior Verification Suite
- gm-vhd: Gas Town graceful degradation - workers work independently
- gm-5tc: Polecat survives crashes via molecule state

## 🏭 Infrastructure Status

### Active tmux Sessions (20+)
**Witnesses (4 rigs)**: 10x_screening, flamingo_dominion, lumicello_inventory, (tanwa_info implied)
**Refineries (3 rigs)**: 10x_screening, flamingo_dominion, lumicello_inventory
**Polecats**: Multiple across all rigs (batch, bugfix, cleaner, designer, furiosa, viz, audit, nux, etc.)
**Dogs**: verify-decom (active), boot (this session)

### Deacon Missing
No Deacon process detected. Last boot check targeted "deacon-missing".

## 📬 Human-Required Work
**18 issues** require human attention (labeled: human, human:decision, human:review, human:blocked)

## 🎯 Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Deacon investigation**: Verify why Deacon is missing and restore if needed
2. **Verification sprint**: 6× P2 verification tasks ready - consider slinging to polecats
3. **Convoy work**: gm-cv-re4ju ready for assignment

### Strategic
- Main convoy (gm-bgh) blocked by 7 verification tasks - completing ready verification work will unblock
- All 3 in-progress tasks assigned to boot - may need delegation/completion check
- 18 human-required issues need triage/routing to overseer
