## 📊 OVERALL STATUS

| Metric | Count | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Overdue** | 0 | ✅ None |
| **Blocked** | 1 | ⚠️ Verification suite blocked |
| **In Progress** | 3 | 🔄 Boot working on verification tests |

## 🚧 BLOCKED WORK

**gm-bgh: Gas Town Behavior Verification Suite**
- Blocked by 7 dependencies (verification tasks)
- 1/8 tasks completed (gm-7ln ✓)
- 2/8 tasks in progress (gm-5tc, gm-vhd - assigned to Boot)
- 5/8 tasks ready to work (P2 verification tasks)

**Convoy Progress:** Main verification convoy at 12.5% completion

---

## 🤖 AI-ACTIONABLE READY WORK

### P2 Verification Tasks (7 issues - ready to sling)
1. **gm-uxw** - [VERIFY] Witness detects stuck polecats (5+ min inactive)
2. **gm-rpc** - [VERIFY] Refinery merges one-at-a-time to main
3. **gm-et9** - [VERIFY] Deacon propagates 'Do Your Job' signal to workers
4. **gm-9to** - [VERIFY] Refinery escalates unresolvable conflicts
5. **gm-ldg** - [VERIFY] Patrol agents use exponential backoff when idle
6. **gm-5v5** - [VERIFY] Polecats fully decommissioned after merge
7. **gm-cv-re4ju** - tanwa.info Content Sections

### P3 Tasks (2 issues)
- gm-9g1
- gm-b1g

**All ready work has NO human-required labels and can be autonomously executed.**

---

## 🔄 WORK IN PROGRESS

Boot currently has 3 issues in progress:
1. **gm-bgh** - Verification suite epic (tracking)
2. **gm-vhd** - [VERIFY] Graceful degradation test
3. **gm-5tc** - [VERIFY] Polecat crash survival

---

## 🚚 CONVOY STATUS

### Active Convoys
1. **gm-bgh** (Main) - Gas Town Behavior Verification Suite
   - Progress: 1/8 (12.5%)
   - Status: Blocked by 5 ready tasks

2. **gm-cv-re4ju** - tanwa.info Content Sections
   - Status: Active

---

## 🐺 POLECAT ACTIVITY

**No active polecats detected** across all rigs.

**Implication:** Ready P2 verification tasks can be slung to new polecats.

---

## 📬 MAILBOX STATUS

**20 unread messages** - Key themes:
- Verification delegation and routing issues (gm-v7jq, gm-d6o)
- Tailscale key renewal alerts (multiple)
- Human-required infrastructure work (lumicello, tanwa_info)
- Bug investigation feedback (ds-2p3)

---

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED ACTIONS

### Immediate (Today)
1. ✅ **P0 Tailscale Alert (fd-2rs)** - Already 3+ days old
   - Send escalation mail to overseer
   - Human action required for key renewal

### High Priority (This Session)
2. **Sling P2 Verification Tasks** - 5 tasks ready
   - Use `~/gt/bin/gt-sling-fix` to create polecats and auto-spawn
   - Unblocks main convoy (gm-bgh)
   - Recommendation: Batch sling all 5 at once for parallel execution

3. **Complete In-Progress Verification Tests**
   - gm-vhd (graceful degradation)
   - gm-5tc (crash survival)

### Medium Priority
4. **Process Mail** - 20 unread messages
   - Triage for actionable items vs informational
   - Route human-required work appropriately

5. **Review Convoy gm-cv-re4ju** - tanwa.info content
   - Check status and progress

---

## 📈 TREND ANALYSIS

**Positive:**
- No overdue issues (good backlog hygiene)
- All ready work is AI-actionable (no human blockers in pipeline)
- Verification convoy making progress (12.5% → ready to accelerate)

**Concerns:**
- P0 Tailscale alert aging (3+ days without resolution)
- Main convoy blocked but has 5 ready tasks sitting idle
- No active polecats (untapped execution capacity)

**Velocity Opportunity:**
Slinging the 5 ready P2 verification tasks would:
- Increase convoy completion to 75% (6/8 tasks)
- Only 1 task remaining after current in-progress complete
- Potential to close entire verification suite this session

---

## 🔧 SESSION PRIORITIES

1. Escalate fd-2rs (Tailscale P0) to overseer
2. Sling 5 P2 verification tasks in parallel
3. Monitor in-progress verification tests
4. Process high-priority mail
5. Update convoy status as tasks complete

---

**Next Triage:** After verification tasks are slung and convoy progresses.
