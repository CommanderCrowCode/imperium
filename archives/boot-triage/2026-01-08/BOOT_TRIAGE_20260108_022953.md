2. **Check stopped polecat** - ds-10x_screening-polecat-nux marked working but stopped

### Short-term (Priority 2)
3. **Work on high-impact blockers:**
   - gm-et9 (Verify Deacon DYFJ propagation) - unblocks 2
   - gm-ldg (Verify exponential backoff) - unblocks 2
4. **Complete verification convoy** - 7 tasks remaining
5. **Finish tanwa.info convoy** - Only 1 task left (ti-5n2)

### Housekeeping
6. **Archive old triage message beads** - 42 historical triage reports cluttering the database
7. **Check MR queue status** - 4 pending MRs across rigs
8. **Process polecat mail** - 2 polecats have unread handoff messages

## 🔍 TRIAGE NOTES

### Label Coverage
- Most issues are unlabeled (no `human:*` or `ai:*` labels)
- Consider running bulk triage to classify:
  - Verification tasks → likely `ai:ready`
  - Infrastructure tasks → check for `human:blocked` patterns
  - Convoy coordination → may need `human:decision`

### Convoy Health
- 2 active convoys (both P2)
- 1 blocked convoy waiting on subtasks (expected)
- Convoy system working as designed

### Blocking Patterns
- Only 1 actual blocked issue (by dependencies)
- Blocking is from incomplete verification tasks (not external)
- Work can proceed on verification tasks to unblock

**Context:** Boot triage completed successfully
