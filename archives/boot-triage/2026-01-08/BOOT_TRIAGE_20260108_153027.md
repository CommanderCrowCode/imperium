## 🎬 Recommended Actions

### 1. Close Resolved P0 Issues
```bash
bd close fd-2rs gm-91g --reason="Tailscale key renewed, expires 2026-07-04"
```

### 2. Sling Verification Tests (Batch)
Sling 6× P2 verification tests to polecats for autonomous execution:
```bash
# Use gt-sling-fix for each test
~/gt/bin/gt-sling-fix gm-uxw <appropriate-rig> witness-verifier
~/gt/bin/gt-sling-fix gm-rpc <appropriate-rig> refinery-verifier
~/gt/bin/gt-sling-fix gm-et9 <appropriate-rig> deacon-verifier
~/gt/bin/gt-sling-fix gm-9to <appropriate-rig> refinery-verifier
~/gt/bin/gt-sling-fix gm-ldg <appropriate-rig> patrol-verifier
~/gt/bin/gt-sling-fix gm-5v5 <appropriate-rig> polecat-verifier
```

**Note:** These tests verify Gas Town infrastructure behavior. Consider creating
a dedicated test rig or using an existing rig with test polecats.

### 3. Monitor Convoy Progress
Once verification tests complete, gm-bgh convoy will unblock and land.
