## 🚧 Blocked Issues (1)

**gm-bgh**: Gas Town Behavior Verification Suite
- Blocked by: gm-5tc, gm-5v5, gm-9to, gm-et9, gm-ldg, gm-rpc, gm-vhd
- **Note**: This is the main convoy - waiting on 7 verification tasks

## ✅ Ready Work (10 issues)

### P2 Verification Tasks (6 issues - HIGH IMPACT BLOCKERS)
These are blocking the main convoy (gm-bgh):

1. **gm-uxw** - [VERIFY] Witness detects stuck polecats (5+ min inactive)
2. **gm-rpc** - [VERIFY] Refinery merges one-at-a-time to main (unblocks 2)
3. **gm-et9** - [VERIFY] Deacon propagates 'Do Your Job' signal to workers (unblocks 2)
4. **gm-9to** - [VERIFY] Refinery escalates unresolvable conflicts (unblocks 2)
5. **gm-ldg** - [VERIFY] Patrol agents use exponential backoff when idle (unblocks 2)
6. **gm-5v5** - [VERIFY] Polecats fully decommissioned after merge (unblocks 2)

### P3 Maintenance Tasks (4 issues)
7. **gm-prr** - Add .runtime/ to crew gitignore files
8. **gm-yds** - Check if gt hook/sling workarounds still needed after gt upgrade
9. **gm-9g1** - [VERIFY] gt handoff gracefully restarts worker
10. **gm-b1g** - [VERIFY] Rig workers can work cross-rig with gt worktree

## 🔄 In Progress (3)

- **gm-bgh** - Gas Town Behavior Verification Suite (assignee: deacon/dogs/boot)
- **gm-vhd** - [VERIFY] Gas Town graceful degradation (assignee: deacon/dogs/boot)
- **gm-5tc** - [VERIFY] Polecat survives crashes via molecule state (assignee: deacon/dogs/boot)

## 🚂 Active Convoys (3)

1. **gm-bgh**: Gas Town Behavior Verification Suite → (main convoy)
2. **gm-cv-rgqcu**: Infrastructure Audit ●
3. **gm-cv-re4ju**: tanwa.info Content Sections ●

## 🎯 Recommendations

1. **Focus on P2 verification tasks** - These 6 tasks are blocking the main convoy
   - Each unblocks 2 other issues
   - All are verification tasks (relatively quick)

2. **Current work in progress** - Boot is already working on 3 verification tasks
   - gm-bgh (main convoy tracker)
   - gm-vhd (graceful degradation)
   - gm-5tc (crash survival)

3. **System Health**: ✅ Excellent
   - No overdue issues
   - No urgent human items
   - No stale work
   - Good pipeline of ready work

## Next Actions

**Immediate priorities:**
1. Complete the 3 in-progress verification tasks
2. Tackle remaining 5 P2 verification tasks to unblock main convoy
3. Once convoy unblocked, address P3 maintenance items

**Note**: All ready work is verification tasks - these test Gas Town behaviors and should be completed systematically.
