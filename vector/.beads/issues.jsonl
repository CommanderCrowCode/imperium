{"id":"ve-10w","title":"MCP Research: Architecture findings from Nexus + deployment_master","description":"\n## Key Findings\n\n### Architecture (from commander_crow/todo)\n\n**Single server with routing, NOT multiple instances:**\n- One MCP server container\n- Workspace/Actor scoping via environment variables\n- Each Claude Desktop connection configured with:\n  - WORKSPACE_ID (tenant/user scope)\n  - ACTOR_ID (which user within workspace)\n\n**Two approaches for Vector:**\n1. Each athlete = separate workspace (total isolation)\n2. Single workspace, athletes = different actors (better for analytics)\n\n**Recommendation: Approach #2** - single workspace, actor-based scoping\n\n### Transport \u0026 Deployment (both experts)\n\n**SSE/HTTP confirmed:**\n- NOT stdio (only works locally)\n- Plain HTTP in container (port 8091 suggested)\n- Caddy/Nginx for HTTPS termination\n- URL: https://vector.tinfoil.lol/mcp (or subdomain)\n\n**Docker setup:**\n- Separate container from main workout-tracker\n- Share PostgreSQL database\n- Health check endpoint: /health\n\n### Authentication (Nexus details)\n\n**Clerk OAuth 2.1 with PKCE:**\n1. Client connects to https://vector.../mcp/sse\n2. Server returns 401 + WWW-Authenticate header\n3. Client reads /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\n4. **Client opens browser** for Clerk login (NOT server-side UI)\n5. User authenticates via Clerk\n6. Client includes JWT in: Authorization: Bearer \u003ctoken\u003e\n7. Server validates via JWKS, extracts user ID (sub claim)\n8. Maps to ACTOR_ID for scoping\n\n**Key insight:** MCP client handles OAuth UI automatically\n\n**Server responsibilities:**\n- WWW-Authenticate header with discovery URL\n- /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource endpoint\n- /.well-known/oauth-authorization-server endpoint  \n- JWKS token validation (cached 1 hour)\n- Map Clerk user ID to internal actor\n\n### Permission Scoping (service layer)\n\n**Athlete tools:**\n```python\n# Filter by actor_id automatically\nasync def list_my_workouts(workspace_id, actor_id):\n    return db.query(Workout).filter(\n        Workout.workspace_id == workspace_id,\n        Workout.user_id == actor_id\n    )\n```\n\n**Admin tools:**\n```python\n# No actor filter - sees all\nasync def list_all_workouts(workspace_id):\n    # Check if actor has admin role first\n    if not is_admin(actor_id):\n        raise PermissionError()\n    return db.query(Workout).filter(\n        Workout.workspace_id == workspace_id\n    )\n```\n\n### Code References from Nexus\n\n**OAuth validation:** nexus/nexus/api/oauth.py\n- Lines 95-155: validate_token() with JWKS\n- Lines 40-72: JWKS caching (1hr TTL)\n\n**Middleware:** nexus/nexus/mcp/fastmcp_server.py\n- Lines 417-479: AuthMiddleware\n- Lines 419-427: 401 WWW-Authenticate response\n- Lines 499-514: protected_resource_metadata endpoint\n- Lines 517-538: oauth_metadata endpoint\n\n**Service filtering:** nexus/nexus/services/task_service.py\n- Lines 45-90: list_tasks with actor/workspace filters\n\n### Deployment Specifics\n\n**Port:** 8091 (deployment_master suggestion)\n**Network:** Same caddy-net as existing containers\n**Database:** Share with main Vector app\n**Access:** Tailscale + HTTPS\n\n### Next Steps\n\n1. Design tool schema (athlete vs admin tools)\n2. Create /mcp directory in workout-tracker repo\n3. Implement FastMCP server with Clerk OAuth\n4. Add to docker-compose.yml\n5. Deploy to velocity\n","status":"closed","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"tanwa@twoflamingos.capital","created_at":"2026-01-27T17:34:47.713074+07:00","created_by":"vector/crew/planner","updated_at":"2026-01-27T17:38:57.6145+07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-27T17:38:57.6145+07:00","close_reason":"Research complete.

Docker Compose Integration\n\nAdd to workout-tracker/docker-compose.yml:\n\n```yaml\nservices:\n  vector-mcp:\n    build:\n      context: .\n      dockerfile: mcp/Dockerfile\n    container_name: vector-mcp\n    ports:\n      - \"127.0.0.1:8091:8091\"\n    environment:\n      - MODE=sse\n      - HOST=0.0.0.0\n      - PORT=8091\n      - CLERK_SECRET_KEY=${CLERK_SECRET_KEY}\n      - CLERK_JWKS_URL=${CLERK_JWKS_URL}\n      - DATABASE_URL=${DATABASE_URL}\n      - WORKSPACE_ID=vector-app\n      - OAUTH_ENABLED=true\n    networks:\n      - caddy-net\n    restart: unless-stopped\n    healthcheck:\n      test: [\"CMD\", \"curl\", \"-f\", \"http://localhost:8091/health\"]\n      interval: 30s\n      timeout: 10s\n      retries: 3\n      start_period: 40s\n\nnetworks:\n  caddy-net:\n    external: true\n```\n\n## 3. Environment Variables\n\nAdd to Infisical (Flamingo Ops / dev):\n- CLERK_JWKS_URL (get from Clerk dashboard)\n\nExisting vars already in Infisical:\n- CLERK_SECRET_KEY\n- DATABASE_URL\n\n## 4. Nginx Configuration\n\nAdd to velocity Nginx config (or Caddy):\n\n**Option A: Subdomain (preferred)**\n```nginx\n# /etc/nginx/sites-available/mcp.vector.conf\nserver {\n    listen 443 ssl http2;\n    server_name mcp.vector.tinfoil.lol;\n\n    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/vector.tinfoil.lol/fullchain.pem;\n    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/vector.tinfoil.lol/privkey.pem;\n\n    location / {\n        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8091;\n        proxy_http_version 1.1;\n        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;\n        proxy_set_header Connection \"upgrade\";\n        proxy_set_header Host $host;\n        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;\n        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;\n        \n        # SSE specific\n        proxy_buffering off;\n        proxy_cache off;\n        proxy_read_timeout 86400s;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**Option B: Path-based**\n```nginx\n# Add to existing vector.tinfoil.lol config\nlocation /mcp/ {\n    proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8091/;\n    # ... same proxy settings as above\n}\n```\n\n## 5. TLS Certificate\n\nIf using subdomain (mcp.vector.tinfoil.lol):\n```bash\nssh velocity\nsudo certbot certonly --nginx -d mcp.vector.tinfoil.lol\nsudo systemctl reload nginx\n```\n\n## 6. Deployment Script\n\nCreate scripts/deploy-mcp.sh:\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nset -e\n\necho \"Deploying Vector MCP to velocity...\"\n\n# 1. Fetch secrets from Infisical\ninfisical export --env=dev --format=dotenv \u003e /tmp/vector-mcp.env\n\n# 2.

Deployment Steps\n\n```bash\n# Local machine\ncd /Users/tanwa/gt/vector/crew/planner/workout-tracker\n./scripts/deploy-mcp.sh\n\n# Verify deployment\ncurl https://mcp.vector.tinfoil.lol/health\n# Should return: {\"status\": \"ok\"}\n\n# Check logs\nssh velocity 'docker logs vector-mcp --tail=50'\n\n# Verify OAuth discovery\ncurl https://mcp.vector.tinfoil.lol/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource\n```\n\n## 8. DNS Configuration (if subdomain)\n\nAdd DNS record:\n- Type: A\n- Name: mcp.vector\n- Value: \u003cvelocity-ip\u003e\n- TTL: 300\n\n## 9. Monitoring\n\nAdd to monitoring (if exists):\n- Health check URL: https://mcp.vector.tinfoil.lol/health\n- Alert if down for \u003e5 minutes\n\n## 10. Firewall (Tailscale)\n\nVerify MCP server accessible via Tailscale:\n```bash\n# From local machine (on Tailscale)\ncurl https://mcp.vector.tinfoil.lol/health\n```\n\n## Testing Checklist\n\n- [ ] Container starts successfully\n- [ ] Health check returns 200\n- [ ] OAuth discovery endpoints accessible\n- [ ] Logs show no errors\n- [ ] Can connect from Claude Desktop (next task)\n- [ ] TLS certificate valid\n- [ ] No port conflicts\n- [ ] Container restarts on server reboot\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] MCP container running on velocity\n- [ ] Accessible via https://mcp.vector.tinfoil.lol\n- [ ] Health check passing\n- [ ] OAuth endpoints return correct JSON\n- [ ] Logs clean (no startup errors)\n- [ ] Auto-restart configured\n- [ ] Deployment script works\n- [ ] DNS resolves correctly (if subdomain)\n\n## Dependencies\n\nBlocked by:\n- ve-q66 (foundation)\n- ve-b1q (athlete tools)\n- ve-ht4 (admin tools)\n\n## Coordination\n\nConsult flamingo_dominion/crew/deployment_master if:\n- Port conflicts\n- Caddy vs Nginx decision\n- TLS certificate issues\n- Network configuration\n","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"task","owner":"tanwa@twoflamingos.capital","created_at":"2026-01-27T17:37:35.979261+07:00","created_by":"vector/crew/planner","updated_at":"2026-01-27T17:37:35.979261+07:00","dependencies":[{"issue_id":"ve-9st","depends_on_id":"ve-b1q","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-27T17:38:44.867521+07:00","created_by":"vector/crew/planner"},{"issue_id":"ve-9st","depends_on_id":"ve-ht4","type":"blocks","created_at":"2026-01-27T17:38:45.875957+07:00","created_by":"vector/crew/planner"}]}

Claude Desktop Configuration\n\nCreate MCP config for testing:\n\n**~/.config/claude/config.json** (macOS)\nor\n**%APPDATA%/Claude/config.json** (Windows)\n\n```json\n{\n  \"mcpServers\": {\n    \"vector-athlete\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.vector.tinfoil.lol/sse\",\n      \"env\": {\n        \"WORKSPACE_ID\": \"vector-app\",\n        \"ACTOR_ID\": \"user_tanwa\"\n      }\n    },\n    \"vector-admin\": {\n      \"url\": \"https://mcp.vector.tinfoil.lol/sse\",\n      \"env\": {\n        \"WORKSPACE_ID\": \"vector-app\",\n        \"ACTOR_ID\": \"user_tanwa_admin\"\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nNote: ACTOR_ID will come from Clerk JWT after OAuth flow\n\n## 2. OAuth Flow Testing\n\n**Test Athlete Login:**\n1. Open Claude Desktop\n2. MCP should prompt for authentication\n3. Browser opens to Clerk login page\n4. Login with athlete account (palmy@example.com)\n5. Redirect back to Claude Desktop\n6. Verify connection successful\n\n**Test Admin Login:**\n1. Repeat with admin account (tanwa@twoflamingos.capital)\n2. Verify admin role detected\n\n**Verify:**\n```bash\n# Check MCP logs for successful OAuth\nssh velocity 'docker logs vector-mcp | grep -i oauth'\n\n# Should see:\n# \"OAuth validation successful for user: \u003cclerk-id\u003e\"\n```\n\n## 3. Athlete Tool Testing\n\nIn Claude Desktop (athlete connection):\n\n**Test vector_my_workouts:**\n```\nShow me my workouts for this week\n```\nExpected: Returns only athlete's workouts\n\n**Test vector_log_completion:**\n```\nMark today's workout as completed with note: \"Felt great, crushed the WOD\"\n```\nExpected: Workout marked complete\n\n**Test vector_my_progress:**\n```\nShow my progress for January 2026\n```\nExpected: Stats for athlete only\n\n**Test permission denial:**\n```\nShow all users in the system\n```\nExpected: Error - tool not available or permission denied\n\n## 4. Admin Tool Testing\n\nIn Claude Desktop (admin connection):\n\n**Test vector_list_users:**\n```\nList all users\n```\nExpected: Returns tanwa, palmy, etc.\n\n**Test vector_user_workouts:**\n```\nShow workouts for user palmy in January\n```\nExpected: Returns palmy's workouts\n\n**Test vector_analytics:**\n```\nShow system analytics for last 30 days\n```\nExpected: Total users, completion rate, etc.\n\n**Test vector_modify_workout:**\n```\nModify workout \u003cid\u003e to change description to \"Updated by admin\"\n```\nExpected: Workout updated, audit log created\n\n## 5. Permission Isolation Testing\n\n**Athlete attempts cross-user access:**\n```\n# As athlete (palmy)\nShow me tanwa's workouts\n```\nExpected: Permission denied\n\n**Athlete attempts admin tool:**\n```\n# As athlete\nShow system analytics\n```\nExpected: Tool not available or permission denied\n\n## 6. Token Validation Testing\n\n**Expired token:**\n- Wait for token to expire (check Clerk settings for TTL)\n- Try to use MCP tool\n- Expected: Re-authentication prompt\n\n**Invalid token:**\n```bash\n# Manually send request with bad token\ncurl -H \"Authorization: Bearer invalid_token\" \\\n  https://mcp.vector.tinfoil.lol/sse\n```\nExpected: 401 Unauthorized\n\n**Missing token:**\n```bash\ncurl https://mcp.vector.tinfoil.lol/sse\n```\nExpected: 401 + WWW-Authenticate header\n\n## 7. Load Testing\n\n**Concurrent connections:**\n```bash\n# Open 5 Claude Desktop instances (different accounts)\n# All connect simultaneously\n# Each runs vector_my_workouts\n```\n\nExpected:\n- All connect successfully\n- No cross-user data leakage\n- Response times \u003c 2 seconds\n- No container crashes\n\n**Monitor:**\n```bash\nssh velocity 'docker stats vector-mcp'\n# Watch CPU, memory during load test\n```\n\n## 8. JWKS Caching Verification\n\n```bash\n# Check logs for JWKS fetch\nssh velocity 'docker logs vector-mcp | grep -i jwks'\n\n# Should see:\n# \"Fetching JWKS from Clerk\" (first request)\n# Then reuse for 1 hour (check timestamps)\n```\n\nExpected: JWKS fetched once, then cached for 1 hour\n\n## 9. Health Check Testing\n\n```bash\ncurl https://mcp.vector.tinfoil.lol/health\n# Expected: {\"status\": \"ok\", \"timestamp\": \"...\"}\n\n# Test unhealthy scenario\nssh velocity 'docker stop vector-mcp'\ncurl https://mcp.vector.tinfoil.lol/health\n# Expected: Connection refused or 502\n\nssh velocity 'docker start vector-mcp'\n```\n\n## 10. Error Handling Testing\n\n**Database down:**\n```bash\n# Temporarily block DB connection\n# Try to use MCP tool\n```\nExpected: Graceful error message (not stack trace)\n\n**Invalid workout_id:**\n```\nGet workout with id \"nonexistent-uuid\"\n```\nExpected: \"Workout not found\" error\n\n## 11. Audit Log Verification\n\nAfter admin modifications:\n```sql\nssh velocity\ndocker exec -it workout-tracker-db psql -U user -d workouts\n\nSELECT * FROM audit_logs ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;\n```\n\nVerify:\n- Admin actions logged\n- actor_id correct\n- changes JSONB populated\n- timestamps accurate\n\n## 12. Performance Testing\n\n**Response times:**\n- vector_my_workouts: \u003c 500ms\n- vector_get_workout: \u003c 200ms\n- vector_log_completion: \u003c 300ms\n- vector_analytics: \u003c 1000ms (complex query)\n\n**Database query optimization:**\n```sql\nEXPLAIN ANALYZE\nSELECT * FROM workouts WHERE user_id = 'user_tanwa' AND date \u003e= '2026-01-01';\n```\n\nVerify indexes used.\n\n## Testing Report Template\n\nCreate TESTING_REPORT.md:\n\n```markdown\n# Vector MCP Integration Testing Report\n\nDate: \u003cdate\u003e\nTester: \u003cname\u003e\nEnvironment: Production (velocity)\n\n## OAuth Flow\n- [ ] Athlete login: PASS/FAIL\n- [ ] Admin login: PASS/FAIL\n- [ ] Token refresh: PASS/FAIL\n\n## Athlete Tools\n- [ ] vector_my_workouts: PASS/FAIL\n- [ ] vector_log_completion: PASS/FAIL\n- [ ] vector_my_progress: PASS/FAIL\n\n## Admin Tools\n- [ ] vector_list_users: PASS/FAIL\n- [ ] vector_user_workouts: PASS/FAIL\n- [ ] vector_analytics: PASS/FAIL\n- [ ] vector_modify_workout: PASS/FAIL\n\n## Security\n- [ ] Cross-user isolation: PASS/FAIL\n- [ ] Admin-only tools protected: PASS/FAIL\n- [ ] Audit logging: PASS/FAIL\n\n## Performance\n- [ ] Load test (5 users): PASS/FAIL\n- [ ] Response times acceptable: PASS/FAIL\n- [ ] JWKS caching working: PASS/FAIL\n\n## Issues Found\n1. \u003cissue description\u003e\n2. ...\n\n## Recommendations\n1. \u003crecommendation\u003e\n2. ...\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n\n- [ ] OAuth flow works for athlete + admin\n- [ ] All athlete tools functional\n- [ ] All admin tools functional\n- [ ] Cross-user isolation verified\n- [ ] Admin tools require admin role\n- [ ] No permission leaks\n- [ ] Load test passes (5+ concurrent users)\n- [ ] Performance acceptable\n- [ ] Audit logs working\n- [ ] Testing report complete\n- [ ] All critical bugs fixed\n\n## Dependencies\n\nBlocked by: ve-9st (deployment)\n\n## Issues Escalation\n\nIf critical issues found:\n1.
