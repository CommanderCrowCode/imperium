Hosting:** tenacity (AS-SG, 2A CPU, 8GB RAM)\n   - Close to persistence for DB latency\n   - Sufficient resources for FastAPI + Next.js\n\n**2. Domains:**\n   - inventory.lumicello.com (or admin.lumicello.com)\n   - Need DNS A record pointing to tenacity (via Tailscale or public IP?)\n\n**3. External Services:**\n   - Wise API (payment tracking)\n   - SeaRates/MarineTraffic (shipment tracking - optional)\n   - SMTP (email notifications)\n   - Alibaba (manual - no API)\n\n**4.

Even with hooks configured, Claude is \"miserably polite\" and waits for confirmation.\n\n## Goal\nPolecats, Witnesses, and all Gas Town agents must auto-execute when they have work hooked. No human intervention required.\n\n## SOLUTION FOUND ✅\n\n### Root Cause\nClaude Code starts in INSERT mode, waiting for user input. Even `tmux send-keys \"gt prime\" Enter` does not reliably trigger execution because Claude sits at the prompt.\n\n### Fix: Piped Input\nPipe the initial command directly to Claude on spawn:\n```bash\necho \"gt prime\" | claude --dangerously-skip-permissions\n```\n\nThis makes Claude process \"gt prime\" as its first input, bypassing the INSERT prompt wait.\n\n### Implementation\nUpdated spawn scripts to use piped input:\n1. `~/gt/bin/gt-sling-fix` - Updated spawn command\n2. `~/gt/bin/gt-spawn-agent` - New universal spawn script\n\n### Spawn Command (GUPP-compliant)\n```bash\ntmux new-session -d -s \"$SESSION_NAME\" \"cd $AGENT_DIR \u0026\u0026 echo 'gt prime' | claude --dangerously-skip-permissions\"\n```\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- [x] Polecats auto-execute on spawn when work is hooked\n- [x] Witnesses run patrol loops automatically\n- [x] No human intervention required after spawn\n\n## Workaround Status\n**Gas Town version**: v0.2.0\n**Workaround needed**: YES - piped input required\n**Scripts to check when upgrading**:\n- `~/gt/bin/gt-sling-fix`\n- `~/gt/bin/gt-spawn-agent`\n\nIf future Gas Town versions natively support auto-execution, these scripts can be simplified to use the built-in mechanism.","status":"closed","priority":0,"issue_type":"task","created_at":"2026-01-05T13:40:34.45372+07:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-05T13:51:27.998894+07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-05T13:51:27.998894+07:00","close_reason":"Solution implemented: piped input (echo 'gt prime' | claude) bypasses INSERT prompt wait.
