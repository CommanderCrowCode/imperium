{"id":"gm-noyr4","title":"Mail context injector: Auto-inject mail summaries into agent sessions","description":"## Problem\n\nAgents miss mail because:\n- Manual checking required (`gt mail inbox`)\n- Tmux notifications fail silently\n- No persistent reminder in agent's view\n\n## Solution: Context Injection\n\nInject mail summaries directly into agent's context window as system reminders.\n\n### Implementation\n\n**1. Hook Integration**\nAdd to existing hooks (SessionStart, UserPromptSubmit):\n```bash\n# In ~/.claude/hooks/UserPromptSubmit.sh\nif [ $((TOOL_CALL_COUNT % 10)) -eq 0 ]; then\n  gt mail inject-context\nfi\n```\n\n**2. Mail Context Injector**\n```bash\ngt mail inject-context [--priority-only]\n\n# Checks:\n# - Unread mail count\n# - Priority/urgent mail\n# - Escalations\n# - Time-sensitive items\n\n# Injects:\n\u003csystem-reminder\u003e\n📬 You have 3 unread messages:\n\nPRIORITY:\n  • 🚨 ESCALATION: Merge conflict (from refinery) - 2h ago\n  \nNORMAL:\n  • Task complete notification (from furiosa) - 30m ago\n  • Status update (from witness) - 1h ago\n\nRun 'gt mail inbox' to see details.\n\u003c/system-reminder\u003e\n```\n\n**3. Injection Rules (Resilience)**\n\n| Rule | Behavior | Why |\n|------|----------|-----|\n| First check | Always inject if unread | Ensure visibility |\n| Subsequent | Every 10 tool calls | Balance attention vs spam |\n| Priority mail | Every 3 tool calls | Urgent items need faster delivery |\n| Escalations | Every tool call | Critical issues |\n| After read | Stop injecting | Don't nag |\n\n**4. Content Filtering**\n\nOnly inject relevant info:\n- Count of unread\n- Sender + subject (truncated)\n- Age (time since sent)\n- Priority flags\n- DO NOT inject full content (token efficiency)\n\n**5. Privacy \u0026 Security**\n\n- Only show mail addressed to current agent\n- Verify agent identity before injection\n- Sanitize mail content (no code injection)\n- Log all injections (audit trail)\n\n### Benefits (Resilience-by-Design)\n\n1. **No Single Point of Failure**: Works even if tmux down\n2. **Self-Healing**: Persistent reminders until mail read\n3. **Graceful Degradation**: Falls back to manual check\n4. **Observable**: Injection logged, can audit\n5. **Defense in Depth**: Complements tmux notifications\n\n### Comparison to Alternatives\n\n| Method | Reliability | Speed | Token Cost |\n|--------|-------------|-------|------------|\n| Tmux notify | Low (silent fails) | Fast | Free |\n| Manual check | Low (forget) | Slow | Free |\n| Context injection | High (always seen) | Medium | ~50 tokens |\n| Persistent queue | High | Slow | Free |\n\n**Best: Combine context injection + persistent queue**\n\n### Implementation Phases\n\n**Phase 1: Basic Injection**\n- Hook integration\n- Unread count injection\n- Every N tool calls\n\n**Phase 2: Smart Filtering**\n- Priority detection\n- Escalation handling\n- Adaptive frequency\n\n**Phase 3: Rich Context**\n- Mail previews\n- Thread summaries\n- Action suggestions\n\n**Phase 4: Two-Way**\n- Quick reply from context\n- Mark as read inline\n- Archive from context\n\n### Testing\n\n1. Send mail to agent\n2. Agent works (doesn't check mail)\n3. After N tool calls → sees mail in context\n4. Agent reads mail\n5. Injection stops\n\n### Token Cost Analysis\n\n- Typical injection: ~50 tokens\n- At 10-call frequency: 5 tokens/call average\n- For /bin/zsh.003/1K input: /bin/zsh.000015/call\n- **Negligible cost for massive reliability gain**\n\n## Success Criteria\n\n- Zero missed urgent mail over 7 days\n- 100% of agents see mail within 10 tool calls\n- No spam complaints (excessive injections)\n- Token overhead \u003c1% of total usage\n\n## Related\n\n- gm-xbh7v: Resilient notification system (broader)\n- tcm-3qf: Watchtower auto-notify (specific case)\n","status":"closed","priority":1,"issue_type":"feature","owner":"tanwa@twoflamingos.capital","created_at":"2026-01-27T17:52:26.879097+07:00","created_by":"mayor","updated_at":"2026-01-27T17:59:31.165376+07:00","closed_at":"2026-01-27T17:59:31.165376+07:00","close_reason":"\nMail context injection implemented and deployed:\n\n✅ Created ~/gt/bin/gt-mail-context-inject script\n✅ Parses gt mail inbox output, extracts unread count and top 3 messages\n✅ Formats as system-reminder for Claude context injection\n✅ Integrated into ~/.claude/settings.json SessionStart hook\n✅ Logs injections for observability\n\nAll agents will now see unread mail context on session startup.\n\nFollow-on improvements filed:\n- gm-a1wg2: Priority mail detection\n- gm-xw4kl: Adaptive frequency\n- gm-ovvo9: Rich previews\n- gm-57sk0: Two-way interaction\n"}

Notification Queue Reader (in gt prime)\n```bash\n# Check for pending notifications\nif [ -f .notification-pending ]; then\n  gt inbox check\n  rm .notification-pending\nfi\n```\n\n### 3. Delivery Confirmation\n- Agent marks notification as read after processing\n- Sender can query delivery status\n- Unacked messages trigger escalation\n\n### 4. Audit Trail\n- All notifications logged with timestamps\n- Delivery attempts logged\n- Escalations logged\n- Full observability of communication flow\n\n## Benefits\n\n1. **No Single Point of Failure**: 5 layers ensure delivery\n2. **Defense in Depth**: Each layer catches what previous missed\n3. **Graceful Degradation**: System works even if tmux fails\n4. **Self-Healing**: Polling ensures eventual delivery\n5. **Observability**: Full audit trail of all communications\n6. **Idempotent**: Safe to retry without side effects\n\n## Migration Path\n\nPhase 1: Add Layer 1 (queue) alongside existing tmux\nPhase 2: Update `gt prime` to check queue\nPhase 3: Add polling to long-running agents\nPhase 4: Add escalation for critical messages\nPhase 5: Deprecate raw tmux send-keys\n\n## Testing\n\n1.
