## 🔴 Critical Issues

### P0: Tailscale Key Expiration (gm-91g)
- **Status:** Mail received at 02:50 today
- **Issue:** gm-78ct - Tailscale key status check
- **Action:** Need to verify key status and handle renewal if expired
- **Priority:** IMMEDIATE (received 1 min ago)

---

## ⚠️ Attention Required

### Orphaned In-Progress Issues (5)
These issues are marked `in_progress` but have no assignee:

1. **gm-5v5** - [VERIFY] Polecats fully decommissioned after merge
2. **gm-9to** - [VERIFY] Refinery escalates unresolvable conflicts
3. **gm-rpc** - [VERIFY] Refinery merges one-at-a-time to main
4. **gm-uxw** - [VERIFY] Witness detects stuck polecats (5+ min inactive)

**Recommendation:** Review if these should be:
- Reassigned to active workers
- Returned to `open` status
- Closed if completed

### Blocked Epic
**gm-bgh** - Gas Town Behavior Verification Suite
- Blocked by 7 verification tests
- Assignee: deacon/dogs/boot
- These are the 4 orphaned tests above plus:
  - gm-5tc: Polecat crash survival (assigned to boot)
  - gm-et9: Deacon DYFJ propagation (ready)
  - gm-ldg: Patrol exponential backoff (ready)
  - gm-vhd: Graceful degradation (assigned to boot)

**Note:** 2 of the blockers (gm-et9, gm-ldg) are actually in `ready` status, so they could be worked.

---

## ✅ Ready to Work (8 issues)

### Priority 2 (High) - 4 issues
1. **gm-et9** - [VERIFY] Deacon propagates 'Do Your Job' signal to workers
2. **gm-ldg** - [VERIFY] Patrol agents use exponential backoff when idle
3. **gm-cv-re4ju** - tanwa.info Content Sections (convoy)
4. **gm-cv-rgqcu** - Infrastructure Audit (convoy)

### Priority 3 (Medium) - 4 issues
1. **gm-prr** - Add .runtime/ to crew gitignore files
2. **gm-yds** - Check if gt hook/sling workarounds still needed after gt upgrade
3. **gm-9g1** - [VERIFY] gt handoff gracefully restarts worker
4. **gm-b1g** - [VERIFY] Rig workers can work cross-rig with gt worktree

**Recommendation:** Start with P2 verification tests (gm-et9, gm-ldg) to unblock the epic.

## 📊 Untriaged Issues (2)

Both are message beads, which typically don't need human/ai triage:

1. **gm-dgtb** - 📋 Boot Triage Complete: 8 ready tasks, 4 orphaned
2. **gm-78ct** - 🚨 Tailscale key status check (gm-91g)

**Recommendation:** Close gm-dgtb (previous triage report). Keep gm-78ct active until resolved.

## 🎯 Recommended Actions

### Immediate (Next 1 hour)
1. **Read mail gm-78ct** - Check Tailscale key status
2. **Handle gm-91g** - Resolve Tailscale key expiration if needed

### Short Term (Today)
1. **Clean up orphaned issues** - Review 5 in-progress tests without assignees
2. **Work P2 verification tests** - gm-et9 and gm-ldg to unblock epic
3. **Review old mail** - 15 unread messages, some from Jan 5-6

### Medium Term (This Week)
1. **Complete verification suite** - Unblock gm-bgh epic
2. **Convoy work** - gm-cv-re4ju and gm-cv-rgqcu
3. **Infrastructure improvements** - gitignore, gt workarounds check

---

## 📈 Trends

**Positive:**
- ✅ 71% overall completion rate (119 closed / 167 total)

## 🛠️ Next Session Recommendations

When next session starts:

```bash
# 1. Check Tailscale mail immediately
gt mail read gm-78ct

# 2. Review orphaned issues
bd list --status=in_progress --json | jq '.[] | select(.assignee == null or .assignee == "")'

# 3. Pick verification work
bd show gm-et9  # DYFJ propagation test
bd show gm-ldg  # Exponential backoff test

# 4. Review unread mail
gt mail inbox
```

**Suggested Priority:**
1. Tailscale key (P0, immediate)
2. Orphaned issue cleanup (housekeeping)
3. Verification tests (unblock epic)
4. Regular work pipeline

**Report End** - Mayor ready for instructions.
